# Effects of Higher-Order Interactions and Homophily on Information Access Inequality

This repository contains code for the paper *Effects of Higher-Order Interactions and Homophily on Information Access Inequality*.

We provide a custom hypergraph class `HyperGraph`that provides access to basic hypergraph properties and inequality. And a child
class `HyperGraphAsymmetricSI` for simulations of a non-linear, group-asymmetric Suscpeptible-Infected model.

We also provide code to generate hypergraphs from our hypergraph model, `CSCM`. 

Finally, we provide scripts that were used to preprocess to conduct simulations, preprocess results, and create plots for paper.

If you found this code useful for your own research, please cite our paper.
